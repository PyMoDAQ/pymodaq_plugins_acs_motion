Instruments

Actuators
+++++++++

* **ACS motion control**: control up to 8 stages.

It has been developped with ACS motion control unit: SPiiPlusEC, linked with a two axis driver (amplifier) UDMnt. 
The stages were alio's translation stages  AI-CM-6000-XY   

Installation instructions
=========================
The user has to install the drivers from ACS. The homing program provided with the stages
must be stored in a buffer of the controller (buffer 1 by default, set with the
'Homing buffer' parameter of the plugin). The plugin never modifies the buffers of the
controller: the Home button runs the homing program and waits for its end, homing all the
axes at once. It is recommended to keep a full backup of the controller application, made
with the Application Wizard of SPiiPlus MMI Application Studio. Users are encouraged to check
the compatibility of their ACS hardware with the latest version of the plugin, and to refer
to the ACS documentation for any specific setup requirements..

* PyMoDAQ’s version: developed with PyMoDAQ 5.3.2
* Operating system’s version: Windows 11 
* The plugin assumes that the acs drivers are installed.
